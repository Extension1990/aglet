# TestApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

## Project setup instructions
Clone this project using: git clone https://github.com/Extension1990/aglet.git

Then navigate inside the project directory: cd TestApp

Next run 'npm install' to install all the angular dependencies then 'ng serve' to run the angular project 

Then from inside project directory run 'cd test-app-server', this is the nodejs server project directory

Repeat the 'npm install' command to install the nodejs server dependencies then 'nodemon server.js' to run the nodejs project

## For MySQL database setup
Inside the TestApp directory, there is a folder called dumps which contains 'Dumps20220213" folder that holds the mysql tables. You can import these files in your mysql database manager. In the test-app-server,you can alter the database connection values to match your system ones.

## Why this approach and tech stack
I wanted to build a single page app using angular, nodejs and express because, both frameworks work well together and use the same language, javaScript which is a browser scripting language. They're both fast and secure. I have added the 'test-app-server' project inside the angular project folder because I wanted to have one git repository instead of two. These technologies are vastly used in modern software development because of their performance, scalability and maintainability advantages. Lastly, these are my primary technology skills.
